# libsm64 - Super Mario 64 as a library

The purpose of this project is to provide a clean interface to the movement and rendering
code which was reversed from SM64 by the [SM64 decompilation project](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64),
so that Mario can be dropped in to existing game engines or other systems with minimal effort.
This project produces a shared library file containing mostly code from the decompilation project,
and loads an official SM64 ROM at runtime to get Mario's texture and animation data, so any project
which makes use of this library must ask the user to provide a ROM for asset extraction.

The entire external-facing API of the shared library can be found in `libsm64.h`. Any client project
making use of the library must only include that header and load the library. There's a minimal example
project under the `test` directory as well, demonstrating usage of the library.

## Building on Mac and Linux

- Ensure python3 is installed.
- Ensure the SDL2 and GLEW libraries are installed if you're building the test program (on Ubuntu: libsdl2-dev, libglew-dev).
- Run `make` to build. If you want to link musl libc instead of glibc run `LIBSM64_MUSL=1 make` instead.
- To run the test program you'll need a SM64 US ROM in the root of the repository with the name `baserom.us.z64`.

## Building on Windows
- [Follow steps 1-4 for setting up MSYS2 MinGW 64 here](https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port#windows), but replace the repository URL with `https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64.git`
- Ensure the SDL2 and GLEW libraries are installed if you're building the test program.
  - 64 bits: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-glew`.
  - 32 bits: `pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-SDL2 mingw-w64-i686-glew`.
- Run `make` to build
- To run the test program you'll need a SM64 US ROM in the root of the repository with the name `baserom.us.z64`.

## Building for Emscripten (Web) (WIP)

Run `emmake make CC=emcc`.

If you want libsm64 standalone to call from JS (may not be that
useful?), then run `emcc dist/libsm64.so -o libsm64.js` afterward to
emit `libsm64.wasm` and `libsm64.js`.

Otherwise, `dist/libsm64.so` should be a compiled WebAssembly object
that you can link into your own C project.

## Make targets (all platforms)

- `make lib`: (Default) Build the `dist` directory, containing the shared object or DLL and public-facing header.
- `make test`: Builds the library `dist` directory as well as the test program.
- `make run`: Build and run the SDL+OpenGL test program.
